            </h2>
            <p>
                I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, <br>therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, <br>having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, <br>therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

            </h2>
            <p>
                For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, <br> the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, <br> one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.
